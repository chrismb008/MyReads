# My Reads Project

This is a React App which allows you to manipulate a list of books. In the main page you have three shelf of books (Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read). You can move books from one shelf to another by clicking on the green arrow next to the book and choose from the list the desired shelf. You can search for other books if you click on the bottom right addition sign and you can move this too in the desired shelf.
